Calculating trajectory descriptors for 65 training videos and 28 test videos takes around 2-2.5 hrs to complete with an average of 1-2 minutes per video. All trajectory descriptors are saved to disk. 

Getting video descriptors for all videos takes a further 1 hr (for calculating the GMM). The fisher vector video descriptors are not saved to disk (However the 64 dimensional trajectory descriptors are saved to disk after PCA).

Using a mixture of 256 Gaussians.

Final accuracy is 57.2 percent :(.
